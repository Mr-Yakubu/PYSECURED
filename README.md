Hey Guys!

So do this to get the app working :

1. Install Python, using this link download and run the latest exe file - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/

2. For installation of pip, open a git terminal inside the PYSECURED folder, then run the code - "python get-pip.py" 

3. Once installed, run - "python -m venv venv" ,  "pip install flask cryptography" , "pip install twilio"  in that order to get the environment and dependencies set up.

4. To run the app after all the required installations, run the command - "python app.py"

ALL THE BEST!
